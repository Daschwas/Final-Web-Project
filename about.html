        <div class="h4"> ORIGINS </div>
        <p>Dale (author) is a programmer born in the 21st century who is known for a litany of different achievements but likely most well known for creating this very website.</p>
        <p>Dale is also an avid snowboarding fan and when not designing sites can be found hitting up the slopes.</p>
        <p> He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of 2023, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Jeeves Stobs.</p>

    <div class="infobox">
        <div class="h4"> LEARNING PROGRAMMING </div>
        <p>Since undergoing this course, Dale has found learning programming is a transformative journey that empowers individuals to unlock the potential of technology. </p>

        <p>Not only does it develop critical skills through logical thinking and precision,it also cultivates a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation</p>

        <p>Programming not only provides the skills to build software applications but also fosters creativity and innovation. </p>

        <p>Embracing the challenges of coding instills resilience and a deep understanding of how computers interpret and execute instructions, making it a rewarding and intellectually stimulating pursuit. </p>

    <div class="infobox">
        <div class="h4"> THE WONDERS OF TECHNOLOGY </div>
        <p>Technology continues to advance and grow - although this website is a small step in my own development in the field of technology,
        several people around the world are achieving incredible things using tech!</p>

        <p>For example, Israeli food tech company Imagindairy expects to launch its animal-free milk proteins by 2023 having completed a US$13m seed funding round.</p>

        <p> Their game-changing tech uses microorganisms to whip up whey and casein, the dairy essentials, without involving a single cow. Say goodbye to ice-cream guilt!</p>

        <p> Addressing methane emissions, a key strategy in combatting global warming, and Imagindairy has shown how we can achieve this via new tech, (while still being able to enjoy ice-cream!). </p>
        <p> How does this relate to my own website? Well, you see...</p>


    </div>
    <div class="infobox">
        <div class="h4"> WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE FOR? </div>

        <p> The purpose of this website is to host the various projects and portfolios that I have worked on over the course of this year. Not only will this serve as a repository of code and knowledge, it allows me (and others) to look back
        and see how far I've come in this one short year. As they, reflecting without having a proper plan in place for it is just day-dreaming.</p>

        <p>With any hope, some of the projects I have worked on as well could prove of interest to others - which may lead to further networking and collaboration.</p>

        <p> Just as Imagindairy innovates to make a positive impact on the environment, my portfolio website showcases my commitment (and small input) to innovation and positive contributions in the world of technology. </p>

        <p>It's not about eliminating cows, but it is about eliminating barriers and creating a space where ideas and creativity flourish. </p>

        <p>I'd love if any of my work makes people think or displays a new way of doing something with coding.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="infobox">
        <div class="h2">THE FUTURE...AND BEYOND?</div>

        <p>In the realm of technology, the future holds endless possibilities - I plan on continuing to update this website as I work on more projects both within Tafe and beyond to continue to display my portfolio.</p>

        <p>As I look ahead in my own journey, I am excited to embrace emerging technologies, refine my skills, and contribute to groundbreaking projects. </p>

        <p>With a passion for continuous learning and a dedication to staying at the forefront of innovation, I am ready to face the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The future is not just a destination; it's an ongoing exploration, and I'm thrilled to be part of the journey. </p>
